    <h3><em>Because you might as well have some extra fun while cooking</em></h3>
    <p>So you want to make this date night special? Well buckle up and get ready for some real life <em>Overcooked</em>and hope the wine helps to avoid another fire department disaster.</p>
    <h2>Red or White Wine?</h2>
    <p>Red and white wine have many differences and similarities. For examples reds are generally bold, rich, and pair well with red meat and tomato sauces. Whites on the other hand, are crisp, zesty and refreshing which work great with seafood, citrus, and lighter flavors. However both will have you cuddling the toilet like a sororiety girl on pledge night after you down a whole box of that nasty Franzia</p>
    <p>Anyway, for tonight's Chicken Piccata, we suggest pairing with a best $20 bottle of white wine you can find with the prettiest label, becuase we all know that's what really matters.</p>

    <h3>Here are our top varieties to pair with tonight's meal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sauvignon Blanc - High acidity and citrus notes to mirror the lemon in the dish</li>
        <li>Pinot Grigio - Crisp and light, with subtle minerality</li>
        <li>Prosecco - Sparkling and refreshing with a little extra flair</li>
        <li>Cava - My personal favorite sparkling wine with notes of honey, minerals, and no weird aftertaste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How To Serve</h3>
    <p>This part is for the wanna-be wine snobs out there, but there really is a best way to serve wine.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chill wine to 45-50 F. Too cold and it'll mute the flavors, too warm and it turns into a sad juice box.</li>
        <li>Unlike reds, most white wines don't need to be aerated ,especially sparkling wines, so just open up the bottle.</li>
        <li>If possible, use the right type of glass for your wine.If you go with a Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, go with a tulip-shaped glass with a smaller bowl to keep the wine cool and focus aromas. If you opt for a sparkling wine, use a tall and narrow flute to minimize surface area and keep the bubbles alive for longer.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now onto the actual cooking portion of the night.</p>
